# Hackathon Discipline

- 48-hour solo build. Working code over perfect code.
- Follow the milestone plan in docs/clash-companion-final-plan-v2.md
- Commit after every working milestone
- Write complete, runnable code — no TODO stubs
- If a task exceeds 1.5x its time estimate, flag it
- The deliverable is a video demo (editable) + public GitHub repo

## Scope Triage
- MUST SHIP: Tap injection, screen capture, STT, parser, Fast Path, pHash hand detection, Queue Path, polished overlay
- SHOULD SHIP: Deck loading + Opus playbook, Smart Path (Haiku)
- CUT IF BEHIND SAT 6 PM: Roboflow targeting + conditional triggers

## Out of Scope
- Multiple games, on-device YOLO, on-device LLM, iOS
- Custom vision model training, automatic elixir reading
- Backend/database — no Supabase, keys live in local.properties
- Hotword biasing (transducer-only in sherpa-onnx, not available for Moonshine)
